Angular application that allows you to interact with a blockchain. You can see the blocks on chain, see transaction within them and even create new transactions and mine blocks.

Built on top of [SavjeeCoin](https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin) (simply Blockchain implementation in Javascript).

## üëÄ Live demo
**[Check it out here.](https://savjee.github.io/savjeecoin-frontend/)** You can create transactions, mine blocks and explore your own blockchain.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Get a copy of the SavjeeCoin front-end running on your local machine (for playing around, testing or development).

```
git clone https://github.com/Savjee/savjeecoin-frontend.git
```

Install the dependencies:
```
cd savjeecoin-frontend
npm install
```

Run the application:
```
npm start
```

At this point the application should be running on your machine on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

**Creating new transactions:** You can create new transactions to any wallet for any amount (no validation). New transactions will be added to the "pending transactions", ready to be included in the next block.

**Pending transactinos:** List of all pending transactions. These will be included in the next block when the mining process starts.
